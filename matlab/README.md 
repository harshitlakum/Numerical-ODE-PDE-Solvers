# MATLAB Scripts for ODE/PDE Numerical Methods

This folder contains MATLAB implementations for classic ODE/PDE problems and their solvers:

- **euler_logistic_compare.m**  
  Explicit Euler method for the logistic growth IVP. Compares to exact solution for various time steps.

- **symplectic_euler_oscillator.m**  
  Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler method for the forced oscillator problem. Plots position and velocity vs. time.

- **cg_laplace_compare.m**  
  Conjugate Gradient for large SPD systems from the 2D Laplacian, with and without incomplete Cholesky preconditioning. Plots convergence.

- **gmres_test.m**  
  Restarted GMRES for unsymmetric systems, including tests with and without ILU preconditioning. Prints iteration statistics for various restart values.

**How to run:**  
- Open any `.m` file in MATLAB and run, e.g.:
  ```matlab
  euler_logistic_compare
  gmres_test    % for the GMRES test (call as a function)
