# Python Scripts for ODE/PDE Numerical Methods

This folder contains Python implementations for several classic ODE/PDE test problems and their solvers:

- **euler_logistic_compare.py**  
  Explicit Euler method for the logistic growth IVP. Compares with the exact solution for various time steps.

- **symplectic_euler_oscillator.py**  
  Symplectic (semi-implicit) Euler method for the forced oscillator problem. Plots position and velocity vs. time.

- **cg_laplace_compare.py**  
  Conjugate Gradient method for large SPD systems arising from the 2D Laplacian, with and without incomplete Cholesky preconditioning. Plots convergence history.

- **gmres_test.py**  
  GMRES with restarts for unsymmetric systems, including tests with and without ILU preconditioning. Prints iteration statistics for various restart values.

**Dependencies:**  
- numpy  
- scipy  
- matplotlib

Install them via:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
